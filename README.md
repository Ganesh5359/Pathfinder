This web-based application allows users to visualize and interact with Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. Users can draw obstacles on a grid, set start and end points, and observe how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between the two points.

Key Features
Interactive grid-based UI for drawing obstacles, setting start and end points.
Visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm in real-time.
User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
Graph data structure for representing the grid and paths.
Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding logic.
